BookSwap
BookSwap is an innovative online platform designed for book enthusiasts to exchange physical books with each other, creating a community-driven library experience.

Project Description
BookSwap aims to address the challenge faced by avid readers like Jen, who accumulate a vast collection of already-read books and seek a solution to explore new titles without constantly purchasing new ones. This platform provides users with a convenient way to exchange books with others, enabling them to discover new reads while sharing their own favorites.

Main Features

Book Addition: Add books to virtual bookshelves, showcasing collections and reading interests.
Profile and Book Updates: Flexibility to update profile details and book information.
Delete Functionality: After book exchanges, delete or mark books as unavailable to maintain an organized collection.

Future Scope
Email Integration: Direct email communication feature, enabling users to seamlessly connect with fellow book lovers with a user-friendly "Send Email" button on each book listing.
User Reviews and Ratings: Enhance the user experience by allowing readers to leave reviews and ratings for the books they've exchanged.
