# BookSwap

BookSwap is an online platform designed for book enthusiasts to exchange physical books with each other, creating a community-driven library experience.

## Project Description

BookSwap aims to address the challenge faced by avid readers like Jen, who accumulate a vast collection of already-read books and seek a solution to explore new titles without constantly purchasing new ones. This platform provides users with a convenient way to exchange books with others, enabling them to discover new reads while sharing their own favorites.

## Main Features

1. **Profile Creation**: Users can easily create profiles, providing personal details and preferences.
2. **Book Addition**: Add books to virtual bookshelves, showcasing collections and reading interests.
3. **Profile and Book Updates**: Flexibility to update profile details and book information.
4. **Search Functionality**: Find specific books users wish to read.
5. **Delete Functionality**: After book exchanges, delete or mark books as unavailable to maintain an organized collection.

## Future Scope

- **Email Integration**: Direct email communication feature, enabling users to seamlessly connect with fellow book lovers with a user-friendly "Send Email" button on each book listing.
- **User Reviews and Ratings**: Enhance the user experience by allowing readers to leave reviews and ratings for the books they've exchanged.
